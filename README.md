# Carousel :cookie:
This project is a Carousel.

View (work in progress) here:
* [Carousel - Live](https://jonathandwood.github.io/Carousel/src/)

It's purpose is to display technical skill in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I will be using:
* [JQuery](http://api.jquery.com/) to animate the slides.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as the taskrunner.
* [SCSS/SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) as a pre-processor for the CSS.
* [Inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) as a Sass framework.

The goals are:
* To have fun.
* Learn.
* Produce something I can be proud of.
